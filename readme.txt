 *  • GirlNames.txt-This file contains a list of the 200 most popular names given to girls
 *    born in the United States from 2000 to 2009.

 * vectors. The user should be able to enter a boy's name, a girl's name, or both, and the
 * application should display messages indicating whether the names were among the
 * most popular.
